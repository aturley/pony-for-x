# Pony for X

Hello and welcome to "Pony for X". Pony for X is a series of introductions to
the [Pony](http://www.ponylang.org) programming language aimed at people who
already know other languages. Each chapter is aimed at users of a specific
language. Currently we have chapters on C#, Erlang, JavaScript and Java
underway. If you are interested in contributing, please see our
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.
